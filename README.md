## What are we building?
We're building the automations and integrations necessary for the Facilities Project Intake Form.  There are two parts to this:
1. We will be building out a GUI for a flowchart sequence possibly using a Switch Statement in Python.
2. We will be creating in-email button triggers so when the AVP/Dean/VP clicks on Approve or Deny, the status is changed in monday.com.


## Facilities Project Intake Form
* Form URL: [https://forms.monday.com/forms/94b24a47ade146e00f794d2a620febf2](https://forms.monday.com/forms/94b24a47ade146e00f794d2a620febf2)
* Board URL: [https://gateway-cc.monday.com/boards/475894573](https://gateway-cc.monday.com/boards/475894573)

The facilities project intake form will have a dropdown where the requester will choose an AVP/Dean.  The selected AVP/Dean will be sent an email where they approve or deny the proposed project.  If approved, an email is sent to the Project Manager requesting quotes for the project from the involved departments.  After the quotes are inputted, an email is sent to the corresponding VP based on the AVP/Dean selection.  If approved, a confirmation email is sent to the Project Manger.
