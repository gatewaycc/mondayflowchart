## What we are building?
1. We will be building out a GUI for a flowchart sequence possibly using a Switch Statement in Python.  This will be created for the Facilities Project Intake Form.
2. We will be creating in-email button triggers where the AVP/Dean/VP will click on Approve or Deny to change the status of the project and move onto the next step.

## Facilities Project Intake Form
Form URL: [https://forms.monday.com/forms/94b24a47ade146e00f794d2a620febf2](https://forms.monday.com/forms/94b24a47ade146e00f794d2a620febf2)
Board URL: [https://gateway-cc.monday.com/boards/475894573](https://gateway-cc.monday.com/boards/475894573)
The facilities project intake form will have a dropdown where the requester will choose an AVP/Dean.  The selected AVP/Dean will be sent an email where they approve or deny the proposed project.  If approved, an email is sent to the Project Manager requesting quotes for the project from the involved departments.  After the quotes are inputted, an email is sent to the corresponding VP based on the AVP/Dean selection.  If approved, a confirmation email is sent to the Project Manger.
